Welcome! I'm a postdoctoral researcher in [Prof. Ricardo Henriques' group](https://henriqueslab.github.io/) at [Instituto Gulbenkian de Ciência](https://gulbenkian.pt/ciencia/) in Portugal. 
If you want to know more about the research projects I'm involved in, please visit the lab's webpage. 

### Who am I?
I'm a woman researchers passionated about **Math** (parallels that may intersect, read Riemmann or let me chat with you and a balloon), (Pseudo-)**Living systems** (let's not discriminate viruses) and **Visual information-communication** (art, photography, drawing). 
So biomedical imaging felt as the perfect match from the very first moment I got into Science.
Basically, I love combining my knowledge in mathematics and computer sciences with biomedical images to write new stories. 

My research interests focus on
1. Contributing to biological discoveries by exploiting image processing techniques
2. Facing current challenges in the intersection between Artificial Intelligence and microscopy imaging.

I'm yet another crazy researcher who believes that science builds upon the effort of the community (i.e., us) to disseminate the advances and relies on responsible collaborations. As such, contributing to a more accessible science (reusable, open, and/or user-friendly) is part of my dedication in research. 

### My research work until now
During my doctorate, I studied cell motility in 3D mesenchymal cell migration. 
For this, I developed automatic methods to process phase-contrast time-lapse movies (segmentation, tracking and detection). 
While studying cell motility was the main project, I had also the chance to work with the currently quite popular, small extracellular vesicles.Together with collaborators, as far as we know, we developed the first automatic method based on DL to segment and detect vesicles in transmission electron microscopy images.  

Because we usually get tones of data with automatic image processing, I did also have space to include a biostatistical method in my thesis. 
We developed a novel approach to assess statistical null hypotheses (H0) in the big-data paradigm (yes, *p-values* are data size-dependent). 

Yet more popular, I'm one of the creators of deepImageJ -an environment to bridge DL to ImageJ-, a core team member of the BioImage Model Zoo, a developer of ZeroCostDL4Mic and DeepBacs, and also a collaborator of the Cell Tracking Challenge.

### Academic gossipping
I graduated in Mathematics at the Universidad del País Vasco (UPV/EHU) in 2014 and also studied at the University of Copenhagen, Denmark in 2012 as an ERASMUS student.
In 2016, I obtained my M.Sc. in Statistical and Computational Data Processing from the Universidad Complutense de Madrid and Universidad Politécnica de Madrid. 
I defended my PhD in Mathematical Engineering supervised by Prof. Arrate Muñoz Barrutia and Prof. Denis Wirtz (Johns Hopkins University) in 2021 at Universidad Carlos III de Madrid in Spain. Since then, I'm a postdoc in Ricardo Henriques Lab at Instituto Gulbenkian de Ciência in Oeiras, Portugal.
