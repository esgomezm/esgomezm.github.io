Welcome!
I'm a postdoctoral researcher in [Prof. Ricardo Henriques' group](https://henriqueslab.github.io/) at [Instituto Gulbenkian de Ciência](https://gulbenkian.pt/ciencia/) in Portugal. 
If you want to know more about the research projects I'm involved in, please visit the lab's webpage. 

### Who am I?
I'm a woman researchers passionated about **Math** (parallels may intersect, read Riemmann, or let's chat with a pen and a balloon), (Pseudo-)**Living systems** (let's not discriminate viruses) and **Visual information-communication** (art, photography, drawing). 
So biomedical imaging felt as the perfect match from the very first moment I got into Science.
Basically, I love combining my knowledge in mathematics and computer sciences with biomedical images to write new stories. 

My research interests focus on
1. Contributing to biological discoveries by exploiting image processing techniques
2. Facing current challenges in the intersection between Artificial Intelligence and microscopy imaging.

I'm yet another crazy researcher who believes that science builds upon the effort of the community (i.e., us) to disseminate advances and that its growth relies on responsible collaborations. As such, contributing to a more accessible science (reusable, open, and/or user-friendly) is part of my dedication in research.

### My research work until now

My research builds upon the ability to ask & translate biomedical questions into math and my skills to develop new image processing workflows using deep learning, among others. 
These are the projects that brought me the chance to prove so:

**Cell motility**. During my doctorate, I studied cell motility in 3D mesenchymal cell migration. 
I'm particularly interested in deciphering the role of the dendritic protrusions formed by the cells to produce contractile movements. 
How are their mechanics related to the cell motility patterns? What is their role in the 3D mesenchymal migration? 
To answer this questions, I developed automatic image processing methods to process phase-contrast time-lapse movies (segmentation, tracking and detection) of cells embedded in 3D Collagen Type I matrices.
The insights we got are all gather in my thesis, which is under embargo for the next year. 
Nevertheless, if you wish to discuss it further, please get in contact with me.

**Small extracellular vesicles**. Cell communication is yet another critical factor in cell migration. Recently, small extracellular vesicles are proven to play a critical role in the many physiological processes, such as tumor growth.
Due to their nanosize, studying their molecular cargo and structure is limited to challenging isolation clearing protocols. Moreover, imaging extracellular vesicles is only possible with advanced super-resolution techniques, which then need to be analysed.
Together with collaborators, we contributed a new automatic method based on DL to segment and detect vesicles in transmission electron microscopy images.

**Biostatistics**. Automatic image processing allows us generating tones of data that need to be analysed afterwards. Namely, dealing with big numbers requires new analytical approaches. 
For this, we developed a novel approach to assess statistical null hypotheses (H0) in the big-data paradigm (yes, *p-values* are data size-dependent). 

**FAIRy deep learning**. Yet more popular, I'm one of the creators of deepImageJ -an environment to bridge DL to ImageJ-, a core team member of the BioImage Model Zoo, a developer of ZeroCostDL4Mic and DeepBacs, and also a collaborator of the Cell Tracking Challenge.

### Academic gossipping
I graduated in Mathematics at the Universidad del País Vasco (UPV/EHU) in 2014 and also studied at the University of Copenhagen, Denmark in 2012 as an ERASMUS student.
In 2016, I obtained my M.Sc. in Statistical and Computational Data Processing from the Universidad Complutense de Madrid and Universidad Politécnica de Madrid. 
I defended my PhD in Mathematical Engineering supervised by Prof. Arrate Muñoz Barrutia and Prof. Denis Wirtz (Johns Hopkins University) in 2021 at Universidad Carlos III de Madrid in Spain. Since then, I'm a postdoc in Ricardo Henriques Lab at Instituto Gulbenkian de Ciência in Oeiras, Portugal.
