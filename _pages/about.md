Welcome!
I'm a postdoctoral researcher in [Prof. Ricardo Henriques' group](https://henriqueslab.org/) at [Instituto Gulbenkian de Ciência](https://gulbenkian.pt/ciencia/) in Portugal. 
If you want to know more about the ongoing research projects I'm involved in, please visit the lab's webpage. 
This site is meant to gather my experience and share the different content that I'm creating.

### Who am I?
I'm a researcher passionate about **Math** (parallels may intersect: read Riemmann or let's chat with a pen and a balloon), (Pseudo-)**Living systems** (are viruses alive?) and **Visual information-communication** (art, photography, drawing). 
So biomedical imaging felt like the perfect match from the very first moment I got into science.
Basically, I love combining mathematics and computer sciences with biomedical imaging to write new stories. 

[My research](/research/) interests focus on
1. Contributing to biological discoveries by exploiting image processing techniques.
2. Facing current challenges in the intersection between Artificial Intelligence and microscopy imaging.

I'm yet another crazy researcher who believes that science builds upon the effort of the community (i.e., *us*) to disseminate advances and that its growth relies on responsible collaborations. As such, contributing to a more accessible science (reusable, open, and/or user-friendly) is part of my dedication and spirit.

### Academic gossipping
I graduated in Mathematics at the Universidad del País Vasco (UPV/EHU) in 2014 and also studied at the University of Copenhagen, Denmark in 2012 as an ERASMUS student.
In 2016, I obtained my M.Sc. in Statistical and Computational Data Processing from the Universidad Complutense de Madrid and Universidad Politécnica de Madrid. 
I defended my PhD in Mathematical Engineering supervised by Prof. Arrate Muñoz Barrutia and Prof. Denis Wirtz (Johns Hopkins University) in 2021 at Universidad Carlos III de Madrid in Spain. During my thesis, I was a visiting fellow in the Computer Vision Group lead by Prof. Thomas Brox at the University of Freiburg and the Biomedical Imaging Group led by Prof. Michael Unser at EPFL, Lausanne. Currently, I'm a postdoc in Prof. Ricardo Henriques Lab at Instituto Gulbenkian de Ciência in Oeiras, Portugal.
