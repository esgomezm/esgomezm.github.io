Welcome! I'm a postdoctoral researcher in [Prof. Ricardo Henriques' group](https://henriqueslab.github.io/) at [Instituto Gulbenkian de Ciência](https://gulbenkian.pt/ciencia/) in Portugal. If you want to know more about the research projects I'm involved in, please visit the lab webpage. 

I'm a researcher with a strong background in mathematics and computer sciences, who loves combining them with biomedical images to write new stories. 
My research interests focus on (1) contributing to biological discoveries by exploiting image processing techniques and (2) facing current challenges in the intersection between Artificial Intelligence and microscopy imaging. I'm yet another crazy researcher who believes that science builds upon the effort of the community (i.e., us) to disseminate the advances, and relies on responsible collaborations. As such, making scientific advancements accessible (reusable, open, and/or user-friendly) is a crucial part of my dedication with research. 

### Academic background
I graduated in Mathematics at the Universidad del País Vasco (UPV/EHU) in 2014. I also studied at the University of Copenhagen, Denmark in 2012 as an ERASMUS student, and obtained my M.Sc. in Statistical and Computational Data Processing from the Universidad Complutense de Madrid and Universidad Politécnica de Madrid in 2016. 
In 2021, I defended my PhD in Mathematical Engineering at Universidad Carlos III de Madrid in Spain, supervised by Prof. Arrate Muñoz Barrutia and Prof. Denis Wirtz (Johns Hopkins University). 
During my doctorate, I developed automatic methods to process transmission electron microscopy images and phase-contrast time-lapse movies (segmentation, tracking and detection). We used these techniques to characterise 3D cancer cell motility. 
I also developed new biostatistical approaches to assess statistical null hypotheses (H0) in the big-data paradigm (yes, *p-values* are data size-dependent). I'm one of the creators of deepImageJ -an environment to bridge DL to ImageJ-, a core team member of the BioImage Model Zoo, and a developer of ZeroCostDL4Mic and DeepBacs. I'm also a collaborator of the Cell Tracking Challenge.
