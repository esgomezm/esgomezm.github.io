Welcome to my web-page! I'm a postdoctoral researcher in [Prof. Ricardo Henriques' group](https://henriqueslab.github.io/) at [Instituto Gulbenkian de Ciência](https://gulbenkian.pt/ciencia/) in Portugal, so if you want to know more about the research projects I'm involved in, please visit the lab webpage. 

I'm a researcher with a strong background in mathematics and computer sciences, who loves using them to write biomedical stories. 
My research interests focus on (1) contributing to biological discoveries by exploiting image processing techniques and (2) face current challenges the world of Artificial Intelligence and microscopy imaging.
A crucial part of my work and dedication is to make research accessible at all means (open, user-friendly, and reusable) and train other scientists to benefit from the work I'm involved in.

## Academic background
In 2021, I obtained her PhD in Mathematical Engineering at Universidad Carlos III de Madrid in Spain, supervised by Prof. Arrate Muñoz Barrutia and Prof. Denis Wirtz (Johns Hopkins University). 
During my doctorate, I developed automatic methods to process transmission electron microscopy images and phase-contrast time-lapse movies (segmentation, tracking and detection).
contribute to the characterization of cancer cell motility and inter-cellular communication. 
I also developed new biostatistical approaches to assess statistical null hypotheses (H0) in the big-data paradigm (yes, *p-values* are data size-dependent). 
I'm one of the creators of deepImageJ -an environment to bridge DL to ImageJ-, a core team member of the BioImage Model Zoo, and a developer of ZeroCostDL4Mic. 
I'm also a collaborator of the Cell Tracking Challenge.
