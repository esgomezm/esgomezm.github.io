Welcome!
I'm a postdoctoral researcher in [Prof. Ricardo Henriques' group](https://henriqueslab.github.io/) at [Instituto Gulbenkian de Ciência](https://gulbenkian.pt/ciencia/) in Portugal. 
If you want to know more about the research projects I'm involved in, please visit the lab's webpage. 

### Who am I?
I'm a woman researchers passionated about **Math** (parallels may intersect, read Riemmann, or let's chat with a pen and a balloon), (Pseudo-)**Living systems** (let's not discriminate viruses) and **Visual information-communication** (art, photography, drawing). 
So biomedical imaging felt as the perfect match from the very first moment I got into Science.
Basically, I love combining my knowledge in mathematics and computer sciences with biomedical images to write new stories. 

My research interests focus on
1. Contributing to biological discoveries by exploiting image processing techniques
2. Facing current challenges in the intersection between Artificial Intelligence and microscopy imaging.

I'm yet another crazy researcher who believes that science builds upon the effort of the community (i.e., us) to disseminate advances and that its growth relies on responsible collaborations. As such, contributing to a more accessible science (reusable, open, and/or user-friendly) is part of my dedication in research.

### Academic gossipping
I graduated in Mathematics at the Universidad del País Vasco (UPV/EHU) in 2014 and also studied at the University of Copenhagen, Denmark in 2012 as an ERASMUS student.
In 2016, I obtained my M.Sc. in Statistical and Computational Data Processing from the Universidad Complutense de Madrid and Universidad Politécnica de Madrid. 
I defended my PhD in Mathematical Engineering supervised by Prof. Arrate Muñoz Barrutia and Prof. Denis Wirtz (Johns Hopkins University) in 2021 at Universidad Carlos III de Madrid in Spain. Since then, I'm a postdoc in Prof. Ricardo Henriques Lab at Instituto Gulbenkian de Ciência in Oeiras, Portugal.
